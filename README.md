# SOHO Network Design Lab (Contoso Simulation)

This project simulates the network design of a small-to-medium company ("Contoso") with around 2 million clients, planning to open a new branch office near Pollena Trocchia.

## Project Overview
Contoso requires a new local network to connect three departments:
- Administration / IT
- Finance / Human Resources
- Customer Service / Reception

Each department must operate on a separate VLAN. Devices must receive IP addresses via DHCP and be able to communicate across VLANs where permitted.

The design includes:
- Cisco-based router and switches
- Subnetting and logical addressing
- DHCP configuration
- Inter-VLAN routing
- Basic topology implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer

## Files Included
- contoso-network-topology.pkt: Cisco Packet Tracer lab file
- contoso-network-design.docx: full design document with requirements, topology diagram and IP plan

## Learning Objectives
- VLAN segmentation in SOHO environments
- Router-on-a-stick configuration
- Network planning for scalability and isolation

## Notes
This lab was created as part of my technical training and is anonymized for portfolio purposes.
